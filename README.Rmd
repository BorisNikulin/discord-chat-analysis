# Text Analysis of a Discord Chat Group

## Data Acquisition
To get the data needed for the analysis, there is the
[discord api Get Channel Message](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#get-channel-messages)
that one can use or one can try and find a discord bot to do it for you.
That requires some setup of the bot so I chose to do bare api calls in python instead.
Thanks to
[DiscordArchiver](https://github.com/Jiiks/DiscordArchiver/blob/master/DiscordArchiver/Program.cs#L15)
for the undocumented (probably old api that may be discontinued on October 16, 2017) url parameter for the token.

After creating `discord_chat_dl.py` and running it with my token, the channel id, and the id of the last message (not included),
I downloaded all the chat logs in json.
I have also manually anonymized the usernames.
